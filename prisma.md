In Prisma, managing changes to your database schema (and reflecting those changes in your application's models) is done using Prisma Migrate. Prisma Migrate lets you handle changes to your database schema in a type-safe and version-controlled manner.

Here's a general overview of how you would migrate database changes in Prisma:

1. **Set Up Prisma** (if you haven't):
   First, make sure you've initialized Prisma for your project.

   ```bash
   npx prisma init
   ```

2. **Modify Your Prisma Schema**:
   Open `schema.prisma` and modify your models to reflect the desired changes.

3. **Generate a New Migration**:
   After modifying your schema, you can create a new migration with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
   ```

4. **Apply Migration to the Database**:
   The above command (`migrate dev`) will also automatically apply the migration to your development database. However, for production databases, you would usually run:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   If you're using Prisma Client to query your database, make sure to regenerate it after the migration:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Rollbacks**:
   As of my last training data in September 2021, Prisma Migrate did not support direct rollback commands. However, to "rollback", you would essentially create a new migration that undoes the changes of the previous migration.

7. **Version Control**:
   Commit your changes, including the migration files, to version control (e.g., Git). This ensures that team members and deployment processes apply the same database changes.

8. **Production Migrations**:
   Before applying migrations to your production database, always test them on a staging or backup environment. Once you're sure about your changes, you can run the `npx prisma migrate deploy` command as part of your deployment process to migrate your production database.

## Safe or not

1. **Safe Operations**:
   - **Additions**: Adding a new table, adding a new column (provided it's nullable or has a default value), or adding a new relation are typically safe operations.
   - **Renaming**: If you rename a field in the Prisma schema, Prisma Migrate will by default treat this as a deletion of the old column and an addition of a new one. To safely rename a column, you'd use the `@map` directive in the Prisma schema to map the Prisma field to the existing column in the database.
2. **Potentially Unsafe Operations**:

   - **Deletions**: Removing a table or column will lead to data loss for that table/column.
   - **Changing Data Type**: Changing the data type of a column, especially if it's not compatible (e.g., from string to integer), can result in data loss or errors.
   - **Making a Column Non-Nullable**: If you have existing rows with null values in that column, this will cause an error unless you set a default value.

3. **Reviewing Migrations**:
   Before applying a migration, you should review the generated SQL to understand what will be executed against the database. This is especially important for potentially destructive changes.

4. **Backups**:
   Always back up your database before applying migrations, especially in a production environment. This ensures that you have a recovery point in case something goes wrong.

5. **Dry Runs & Staging Environments**:
   Test your migrations in a staging or development environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. This will give you confidence in the migration and alert you to any potential issues.

6. **Customizing Migrations**:
   If the automatically generated SQL does not handle a particular migration in the way you'd like, you can manually modify the migration's SQL to better suit your needs. This requires a strong understanding of SQL and the specific database you're working with.

7. **Data Migrations**:
   In cases where you need to transform data (e.g., splitting a column into two), you'd typically do this in two steps:
   - Create a migration to add the new columns without removing the old one.
   - Write and execute a script to migrate and transform the data from the old column to the new ones.
   - Create another migration to remove the old column.
