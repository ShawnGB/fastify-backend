In Prisma, managing changes to your database schema (and reflecting those changes in your application's models) is done using Prisma Migrate. Prisma Migrate lets you handle changes to your database schema in a type-safe and version-controlled manner.

Here's a general overview of how you would migrate database changes in Prisma:

1. **Set Up Prisma** (if you haven't):
   First, make sure you've initialized Prisma for your project.

   ```bash
   npx prisma init
   ```

2. **Modify Your Prisma Schema**:
   Open `schema.prisma` and modify your models to reflect the desired changes.

3. **Generate a New Migration**:
   After modifying your schema, you can create a new migration with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
   ```

4. **Apply Migration to the Database**:
   The above command (`migrate dev`) will also automatically apply the migration to your development database. However, for production databases, you would usually run:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   If you're using Prisma Client to query your database, make sure to regenerate it after the migration:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Rollbacks**:
   As of my last training data in September 2021, Prisma Migrate did not support direct rollback commands. However, to "rollback", you would essentially create a new migration that undoes the changes of the previous migration.

7. **Version Control**:
   Commit your changes, including the migration files, to version control (e.g., Git). This ensures that team members and deployment processes apply the same database changes.

8. **Production Migrations**:
   Before applying migrations to your production database, always test them on a staging or backup environment. Once you're sure about your changes, you can run the `npx prisma migrate deploy` command as part of your deployment process to migrate your production database.

Remember to regularly check Prisma's documentation and release notes. Prisma is actively developed, and there could be new features or changes in the migration process.
